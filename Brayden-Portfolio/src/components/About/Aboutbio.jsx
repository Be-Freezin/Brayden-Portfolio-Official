        Hey, I’m <span className="">Brayden!</span> An ambitious Front End
        Developer who's been building my web development chops for over a year.

        Hailing from the land of maple syrup and hockey, I made the move to
        Chicago from Canada three years ago to be with my significant other.
        Since then, I have immersed myself in the world of web development,
        dedicating countless hours to learning and perfecting my craft. I’m
        eagerly seeking my first role in the industry, ready to put my skills to
        the test and continue growing as a developer. With a keen eye for detail
        and enthusiasm for coding, learning and growing, I feel I can be a
        valuable addition to any team.
