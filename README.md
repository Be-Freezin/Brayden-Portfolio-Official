 ## GENERAL TASKS

 <!-- *  Fix skills section on mobile, the skill blocks are way to close to the header -->
 *  Fix tags on the project cards on mobile
 *  Make mobile dropdown nav list items into links
 *  Make nav bar fixed to top
 <!-- *  reposition the interests hover cards on mobile so they stay within screen -->
 *  reformat our code. The skills, interests, interests cards, and projects are DRY. Make a data.js file for these components so we can map over them. Reducing the amount of times we need to duplicate our code per section.
 *  Add a footer
